- **Communication:** Good goalies lead their defense. Coaches value those who can effectively direct teammates during plays.
- **Anticipation:** Being able to read the game is vital. Coaches prefer goalies who can predict shots and react quickly.

- **Communication:** Demonstrate leadership skills by directing your teammates. Good goalies are vocal on defense.
- **Footwork:** Showcase your ability to move laterally and adjust your position quickly. This is vital for making saves.

### Highlighting Your Skills:

When considering colleges, it's important to focus on programs that fit your playing style, skills, and overall goals, rather than solely on whether they have a preference for left-handed players. Here are a few tips to help you find the right fit:

1. **Research Programs**: Look into college water polo programs and their rosters. See if they have a history of recruiting left-handed players, but more importantly, evaluate their overall coaching style and how they develop their athletes.

2. **Reach Out to Coaches**: When you contact coaches, you can mention your left-handedness as part of your unique skill set. This can help them see how you can contribute to their team.

3. **Attend Showcases and Camps**: Participate in water polo showcases or camps where you can demonstrate your skills in front of multiple coaches. This can help you gain visibility and show how your left-handedness can be an advantage.

4. **Focus on Your Skills**: Regardless of handedness, skills, versatility, and a strong work ethic are what coaches are often looking for. Make sure to showcase your strengths during recruitment.

Here are some reasons to consider specializing:

1. **Skill Development**: Concentrating on one position allows you to hone specific skills that are crucial for that role. This can make you stand out to coaches who are looking for players who excel in particular areas.

2. **Clear Role Definition**: Coaches often prefer recruits who fit specific needs within their program. By defining a clear position for yourself, you can present yourself as a strong candidate for that role.

4. **Create a Highlight Reel**: Compile a highlight video of your best plays. Include your swim time, shooting skills, defensive plays, and any other standout moments. Share this video with coaches when reaching out.

5. **Reach Out to Coaches**: Don't hesitate to contact college coaches directly. Introduce yourself, express your interest in their program, and share your stats and highlight reel. Personalize your messages to show that you've done your research on their team.

6. **Network**: Leverage your current coaches, teammates, and mentors. They may have connections or insights into programs that could be a good fit for you.

Here are some key factors to consider:

1. **NCAA Division Level**: There are three divisions in NCAA water polo (Division I, II, and III). Division I typically has the highest level of competition, while Division II and III may offer a more balanced approach between athletics and academics. Based on your impressive GPA of 3.9, you might also want to consider programs that value both academics and athletics.

2. **Skill Level**: Assess your current skills and performance metrics, including your 50m swim time of 25 seconds, which is quite competitive. Compare your performance to NCAA averages to determine where you might fit best. Typically, stronger athletes may excel in Division I, while others may find success and satisfaction in Division II or III.

3. **Program Fit**: Look for programs that align with your academic interests and career goals. Some schools may have a strong academic reputation in your desired field, which could be just as important as the athletic program.

4. **Coaching Style**: Research coaches and their philosophies. Finding a coach whose style matches your own can be crucial for your development and enjoyment of the sport.

5. **Location and Campus Life**: Consider where you want to live and what type of campus environment you prefer. This can greatly impact your college experience.

6. **Recruitment Process**: Starting your recruitment process early will give you the chance to showcase your skills and find a program that fits you best.

Ultimately, the right level for you is one where you can thrive both athletically and academically.

On average, high school male water polo wings are around:
- **Height**: Approximately 180 cm to 185 cm (5'11"" to 6'1"")
- **Weight**: About 70 kg to 80 kg (154 lbs to 176 lbs)

As a 190 cm tall (6'3"") and 170 kg (374 lbs) wing, you are taller than average, which can be an advantage in terms of reach and physical presence in the water. However, your weight is significantly above the average for high school players, which might impact your agility and swimming speed.

It's important to focus on your strengths, like your height and swim time, and work on maintaining a balance between strength and agility. Coaches often look for players who can use their physical attributes effectively in the game.

1. **Swimming Speed**: Your 50m swim time is crucial, as water polo is a fast-paced game where speed can make a big difference. Coaches typically look for times under 25 seconds for wings.

2. **Scoring Ability**: Goals scored, assists, and shooting percentage are important. They demonstrate your offensive skills and ability to contribute to the team's success.

3. **Defensive Stats**: Steals, blocks, and exclusions drawn show your ability to impact the game defensively.

4. **Game Experience**: Playing time and performance in competitive settings (like club or high school teams) can be significant. Coaches like to see players who can handle pressure.

5. **Physical Attributes**: Height and weight can play a role, especially in water polo, where size can help in both offensive and defensive situations.

6. **Academic Performance**: Your GPA (like your impressive 3.7) is critical, especially for NCAA recruitment, as many programs value student-athletes who excel academically.

7. **Work Ethic and Attitude**: Coaches also pay attention to your commitment, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Showing dedication in practice and games can set you apart.
